Here you'll find all forty runes of the Old Tongue with their corresponding letters in the new tongue along with their pronounciation notes. You will also find the usage of different accents.

The <b>Old Tongue</b>, once carved into stone by the gods and the first mortals, is largely forgotten as a spoken language. While both tongues use the same sounds, they differ writing: The <b>Old Tongue</b> uses a <b>runic alphabet </b> while the <b>New Tongue</b> relies on letters. and the new script uses letters.

Although the old language itself is lost, names of people, places and artifacts of significance have been passed down through generations, keeping their original forms. Today, these special names are represented using the letters of the New Tongue.

|----------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ^                    | Ânthor    | The circumflex elongates vowel by double its length.                                                          |
| ˊ                    | Ŕuai      | The acute accent on a vocal or consonant suggests stress.                                                     |
| ’                    | Sa’en     | The apostrophe between vowels suggests a glottal stop.                                                        |
| ^ (after consonant)  | Kâr       | The circumflex after a consonant softens both consonant and vowel.                                            |
| H before consonants  | Khâr      | Using H before certain consonants negates the softening effect of the circumflex.                             |
| ˚ (trill marker)     | R̊uk       | Marks a consonant as trilled or rolled. Appears after the base letter. Not a diacritic, but a modifier.        |

## Invalid Accent and Diacritic Usage

1. The Accent Collision Rule
While the diacritics (˚) and (^) can exist on two consecutive letters, a letter will never carry both a circumflex (^) and an acute accent (ˊ). Such a combination is considered invalid in the script’s orthography.

2. Double Accents Across Diphthongs
Only one accent may be applied to a diphthong. Accents cannot be stacked across a diphthong, ensuring that each accented syllable receives only one accent.

3. Accent Placement on Consonants and Vowels
The acute accent (ˊ) can be placed on consonants. When placed on a consonant, the acute accent (ˊ) suggests stress. In order to stress a vowel, a circumflex (^) is placed on the vowel. This always elongates the vowel as well as stressing it.

4. Glottal Stop (’) Overriding Softening
If a glottal stop (’) is present, it will override the softening effect of the circumflex (^). For instance, in a word like Lâ’ân, the glottal stop (’) takes precedence over the softening effect of the circumflex (^) on the second vowel, ensuring that the consonant is not softened as it would typically be.

5. Invalid Diacritic Stacking
A letter can never carry both a circumflex (^) and an acute accent (ˊ) simultaneously. Combinations like Â’ê are not allowed in the script and will be considered incorrect orthographically.

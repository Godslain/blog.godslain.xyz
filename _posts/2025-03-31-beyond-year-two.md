It’s been over **two years** now since we started development. Over that time, we’ve worked extensively on the **open-world terrain** and have **finalized our building assets**. We scrapped our initial character assets, **redesigned them**, and added **a variety of wearable and wieldable items**.  

In **Godslain: TCT**, you can recruit **up to 20 allies**, engage in **army battles**, and explore **dungeons solo**. We’ve also introduced a **sand-skating** mechanic.  

## Gameplay Development  

We tried multiple approaches:  
- A **top-down strategy controller**, allowing you to move other units around  
- An **FPS controller**  
- A **top-down + TPS controller**, inspired by *Dragon Age*  

We’ve also added **12 new creatures (mobs)** with unique AI and skills (**excluding human mobs**).  

## The Team & What's Next  

For a **whole year**, we focused heavily on **terrain, in-game buildings, and the overall design** of *Godslain:TCT*.  

Over the past year, our **small indie team** has made **significant progress**, from terrain and asset development to core gameplay mechanics like **quests, combat, and army control**.  

What started as a **solo project** has grown with the help of talented collaborators, including **3D artist Astrid** and **programmer Relik**.  

We settled on a **third-person perspective (TPS)** because it allows us to focus on **one controller and perfect it**. This also lets us develop **assets specifically designed for that look**.  

### Moving Forward  

Our current focus is on **adding more content, expanding quests, and introducing new NPCs**.

Hello everyone, I am Astrid and I have been working on 3D modeling, texture painting and animations for Godslain for over a year. The first character we designed is Khauldun —a significant character for the story. **Spoiler alert:** This depicts his warform. Below is a simple sketch by Yarscreative as a starting point of reference.

We deviated from the sketch and ended up with the following character base.

Here’s what Khauldun looks like after some texture painting.

We made simple locomotion animations for him but later on decided against rolling our own animations for a humanoid character. Nevertheless it was a fun experience.

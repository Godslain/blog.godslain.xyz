### The Forgotten Alphabet

The Forgotten Alphabet comprises 40 runic symbols that were used to inscribe stone during the dawn of creation. The
origin of this alphabet is a mystery, with very little known about its genesis. Some speculate that it is the language
of the gods, while others attribute its creation to the Kharthìr. What is known is that the Kharthìr etched these
ancient runes onto the walls of their halls, dwellings and stelae.

The first rune in the alphabet is "Sa'en", which signifies "The first one" and "The one who is no more.". This rune is
seldom utilized in writings and is the starting point for all other runes. The subsequent runes in the alphabet are
achieved by removing certain lines from the Sa'en rune, each representing a vowel or consonant, with a few exceptional
cases. These exceptional cases will be explained further in the following sections.

Below, you will find the complete set of The Forgotten Alphabet, also known as The Ancient Runes.
